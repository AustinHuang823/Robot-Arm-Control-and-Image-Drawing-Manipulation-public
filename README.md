# Robot Arm Control & Image Drawing Manipulation - public version - Project Overview

This README outlines the public version of the project developed by Group 7 for the EN.530.646 Robotics Devices Kinematics, Dynamics, and Control course. Utilizing ROS and MATLAB, we've implemented a sophisticated algorithm to handle a pick-and-place task, alongside a unique extra credit task involving drawing the Johns Hopkins University logo.

## Project Description

Our project focuses on controlling a robot arm to perform specific tasks, including object manipulation and image drawing. Due to academic integrity policies, we are unable to share the code publicly. However, this document provides an overview of our approach, implementation methods, and achievements.

### Implementation Highlights

- **Inverse Kinematics** and **Resolved-Rate Control** for precise movement and placement.
- **Transpose Jacobian-based Control** for improved efficiency and stability.
- **Extra Credit**: Successfully programmed the robot to draw the JHU logo using image processing techniques and robot kinematics.

### System Workflow

A user-friendly interface through MATLAB scripts facilitates interaction with the project, allowing for dynamic input and control of the robot arm for various tasks.

### Key Achievements

- Efficient implementation of complex algorithms ensuring accuracy and reliability.
- Overcoming challenges such as table collision, singularity issues, and workspace limitations.
- Creativity in applying image processing for artistic drawing with the robot arm.

### Note to the Public

This project is a demonstration of our team's capability in robotics control and algorithm implementation. While the code is not available due to school regulations, we hope this overview provides insight into our project's scope and accomplishments.
